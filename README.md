# JJ Playground

This is a repository for exploring the ['jj'](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) DVCS.

I've discovered that editing PR branches is a nice workflow for preserving
clean commit history.  I have tried this multiple times, and it works great.

I need to determine what happens if someone else bases work off of my branch.
